# Code Quality Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the code quality improvements made in the `fix/consolidate-and-lint` branch.

## Key Improvements

1. **Ruff Configuration**: Updated pyproject.toml to use the modern ruff configuration format.

2. **Type Annotations**:
   - Added proper typing for `**kwargs` parameters
   - Added type annotations for test functions
   - Improved return type annotations

3. **Code Structure**:
   - Replaced magic numbers with named constants
   - Used list comprehensions for better performance and readability
   - Improved line length handling

4. **Exception Handling**:
   - Replaced generic exception catching with specific exception types
   - Added more descriptive error messages
   - Fixed error handling in agent implementations

5. **Docstring Formatting**:
   - Added module docstrings to missing files
   - Fixed docstring formatting to follow Google style
   - Added blank lines between summary and description in docstrings

6. **Logging Improvements**:
   - Replaced f-strings in logging calls with proper string formatting
   - Removed redundant exception objects in logging.exception calls
   - Made log messages more descriptive

7. **Datetime Handling**:
   - Added proper timezone information to datetime calls
   - Fixed timezone-related warnings

## Remaining Issues

While many issues were fixed, some remain for future improvements:

1. **Complex Functions**: Several functions exceed the complexity threshold and should be refactored.
2. **Long Lines**: Some long lines remain that could be further split for readability.
3. **Additional Type Annotations**: More type annotations could be added throughout the codebase.

## Next Steps

Future code quality improvements could include:

1. Breaking down complex functions into smaller, more manageable pieces
2. Adding more comprehensive test coverage
3. Further improving type annotations throughout the codebase
4. Adding more detailed documentation
