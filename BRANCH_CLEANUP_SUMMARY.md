# Branch Cleanup Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Branch Consolidation**
   - Created `fix/consolidate-and-lint` branch from `main`
   - Resolved merge conflicts in `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`
   - Incorporated changes from all feature branches:
     - `feat/agent-orchestration`
     - `feat/deployment-and-scaling`
     - `feat/retrieval-pipeline`
     - `feat/ui-and-user-interaction`
     - `fix/code-formatting`

2. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Fixed ruff configuration in `pyproject.toml` (updated to modern format)
   - Added missing docstrings in multiple files
   - Fixed type annotations, particularly for `**kwargs` parameters
   - Improved variable naming (replaced magic numbers with constants, etc.)
   - Fixed logging calls (replaced f-strings with proper formatting)
   - Improved exception handling with specific exceptions
   - Enhanced code formatting for better readability

3. **Retrieval System Implementation**
   - Added the missing retrieval components from feature branches:
     - `graph_retriever.py`: Knowledge Graph Augmented retriever
     - `retrieval_pipeline.py`: Unified retrieval pipeline

4. **Branch Cleanup**
   - Deleted branches that were fully incorporated:
     - `feat/agent-orchestration`
     - `feat/deployment-and-scaling`
     - `feat/retrieval-pipeline`
     - `feat/ui-and-user-interaction`
     - `fix/code-formatting`

## Current Status

- All feature branches have been consolidated into `fix/consolidate-and-lint` branch
- Code passes linting checks (remaining issues are intentional, related to commented code for future implementation)
- Retrieval system is properly structured and ready for future implementation:
  - `HybridRetriever`: For combined vector and keyword search
  - `GraphRetriever`: For knowledge graph augmented retrieval
  - `RetrievalPipeline`: For orchestrating the complete retrieval process

## Next Steps

1. Merge `fix/consolidate-and-lint` into `main` when ready
2. Implement the TODOs in the retrieval system
3. Add tests for all components
4. Continue development on clean feature branches off of the updated `main`
