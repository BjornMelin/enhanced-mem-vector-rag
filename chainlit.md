# Enhanced Mem-Vector RAG

EMVR is a developer-friendly hybrid-RAG toolkit merging Graphiti, Qdrant, Mem0, LlamaIndex, and LangChain into one powerful engine.

## Features

- **Hybrid RAG**: Combined vector and knowledge graph-based retrieval
- **Advanced Memory Management**: Long-term semantic memory + procedural/temporal memory
- **Agent Orchestration**: Supervisor-worker pattern with specialized agent roles
- **Persistent Knowledge**: Store and retrieve information across sessions

## Getting Started

You can interact with the system to:

1. **Search**: Ask questions to retrieve information from the knowledge base
2. **Ingest**: Add new documents, URLs, or text to the system
3. **Analyze**: Process information and extract insights
4. **Create**: Generate new content based on existing knowledge

## Examples

Try asking:
- "What information do we have about LlamaIndex?"
- "Can you summarize the latest documents on vector databases?"
- "Search for information about hybrid retrieval"
