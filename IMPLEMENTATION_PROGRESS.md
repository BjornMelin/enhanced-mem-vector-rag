## Recent Activity

- Initialized project structure and setting files
- Implemented core memory interfaces:
  - Vector memory store using Qdrant
  - Graph memory store using Neo4j
  - Memory manager for hybrid operation
- Created MCP server implementation with FastMCP
- Implemented comprehensive retrieval system:
  - Base retriever interface
  - Vector-based retriever using Qdrant
  - Graph-based retriever using Neo4j
  - Hybrid retriever combining both approaches
  - Fusion retriever with reranking
  - Retrieval pipeline for unified access
- Implemented basic ingestion pipeline
- Added MCP endpoints for retrieval and ingestion
- Started agent implementation with memory-augmented capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Complete the agent system implementation
   - Add LangGraph workflows
   - Implement specialized worker agents
   - Create agent orchestration
2. Develop UI layer using Chainlit
   - Create basic search interface
   - Add document management
   - Implement agent interaction
3. Set up deployment architecture
   - Create Docker configurations
   - Set up Docker Compose orchestration
   - Add monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana

## Blockers

No current blockers.

## Notes

The implementation is following the architecture defined in CLAUDE.md, which emphasizes a modular design that integrates multiple retrieval methodologies.

Current focus is on building a solid foundation before moving to more complex components like agent workflows and UI interfaces.
