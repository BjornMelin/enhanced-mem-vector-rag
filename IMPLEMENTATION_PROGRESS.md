  - Vector memory store using Qdrant
  - Graph memory store using Neo4j
  - Memory manager for hybrid operation
- Created MCP server implementation with FastMCP
- Implemented comprehensive retrieval system:
  - Base retriever interface
  - Vector-based retriever using Qdrant
  - Graph-based retriever using Neo4j
  - Hybrid retriever combining both approaches
  - Fusion retriever with reranking
  - Retrieval pipeline for unified access
- Implemented basic ingestion pipeline

- Implemented complete agent system with LangGraph:
  - Base supervisor agent orchestrating worker agents
  - Research worker agent for information retrieval
  - Knowledge graph worker agent for graph operations
  - Memory management worker agent for entity management
  - MCP endpoints for agent interaction
  - Thread-based conversation context tracking
- Developed Chainlit UI with components for chat, document upload, and visualization
- Added Docker and Docker Compose configuration for all system components
- Implemented a comprehensive setup script for initial project setup

- Implemented monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

## Next Steps

1. Complete testing framework
   - Add unit tests for all components
   - Create integration tests for the full system
   - Set up benchmark suite for performance testing
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure GitHub Actions workflow
   - Add automated testing and deployment
3. Enhance documentation
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Add usage examples and tutorials

## Blockers

No current blockers.

## Notes

The implementation is following the architecture defined in CLAUDE.md, which emphasizes a modular design that integrates multiple retrieval methodologies.

Current focus is on testing and documentation, having completed the core functionality, UI implementation, and deployment configurations.
