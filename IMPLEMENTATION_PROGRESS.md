# Enhanced Mem-Vector RAG Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (COMPLETED)

- [x] Create basic project structure
- [x] Setup configuration management
- [x] Implement database connections (Qdrant, Neo4j, Supabase)
- [x] Create memory interfaces:
  - [x] Mem0 interface (abstraction for Qdrant vector memory)
  - [x] Graphiti interface (abstraction for Neo4j graph memory)
- [x] Implement unified memory manager
- [x] Setup MCP server with memory endpoints:
  - [x] `memory_create_entities`
  - [x] `memory_create_relations`
  - [x] `memory_add_observations`
  - [x] `memory_search_nodes`
  - [x] `memory_read_graph`
  - [x] `memory_delete_entities`
  - [x] `search_hybrid`
  - [x] `graph_query`
- [x] Implement basic embedding manager

## Phase 2: Ingestion Pipeline (COMPLETED)

- [x] Implement file loaders:
  - [x] Basic file loading functionality with LlamaIndex
  - [x] Support for text files
  - [x] Directory processing
- [x] Implement web loaders:
  - [x] URL content fetching with LlamaIndex
  - [x] Multiple URL processing
- [x] Create text processing pipeline:
  - [x] Text splitting/chunking (placeholder, will enhance with LlamaIndex)
  - [x] Metadata extraction and management
- [x] Integrate embedding generation
- [x] Setup ingestion pipeline:
  - [x] Pipeline for processing documents through embeddings to memory
  - [x] Storage in both vector and graph memory
  - [x] Entity creation in graph for ingested documents
- [x] Implement MCP endpoints for ingestion:
  - [x] `ingest_text`
  - [x] `ingest_file`
  - [x] `ingest_url`
  - [x] `ingest_directory`
- [x] Update server initialization to include ingestion pipeline
