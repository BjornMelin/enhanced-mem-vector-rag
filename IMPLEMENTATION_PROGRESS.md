## Recent Activity

- Initialized project structure
- Set up base memory interfaces
- Implemented Vector memory store using Qdrant
- Implemented Graph memory store using Neo4j
- Created memory manager integrating both stores
- Started MCP server implementation using FastMCP

## Next Steps

1. Complete the retrieval system implementation
2. Enhance memory interfaces with additional operations
3. Implement ingestion pipeline components
4. Develop agent system starting with basic memory-augmented agent
5. Begin UI implementation with Chainlit

## Blockers

No current blockers.

## Notes

The implementation is following the architecture defined in CLAUDE.md, which emphasizes a modular design that integrates multiple retrieval methodologies.

Current focus is on building a solid foundation before moving to more complex components like agent workflows and UI interfaces.
