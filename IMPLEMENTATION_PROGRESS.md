## Next Steps

1. Set up deployment architecture
   - Create Docker configurations
   - Set up Docker Compose orchestration
   - Add monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
2. Implement testing framework
   - Add unit tests for core components
   - Create integration tests for the full system
3. Enhance the existing UI
   - Add more visualization options
   - Improve agent interaction interface
   - Implement performance optimizations

## Blockers

No current blockers.

## Notes

The implementation is following the architecture defined in CLAUDE.md, which emphasizes a modular design that integrates multiple retrieval methodologies.

Current focus is on deployment, testing, and enhancing the existing UI system.
