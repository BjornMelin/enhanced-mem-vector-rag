‚ö° Developer-friendly hybrid-RAG toolkit merging Graphiti, Qdrant, mem0, LlamaIndex, and LangChain into one powerful engine.

This implementation creates a sophisticated knowledge retrieval system by integrating KAG methodologies with traditional RAG approaches. It seamlessly combines Graphiti's graph intelligence, Qdrant's vector capabilities, and mem0's memory persistence - all accessible through flexible LlamaIndex and LangChain interfaces for applications requiring both factual accuracy and contextual understanding.

## Overview

Enhanced Memory Vector RAG (EMVR) is a comprehensive framework that combines the strengths of multiple retrieval methodologies to create a more robust, accurate, and contextually aware knowledge system. By integrating graph-based Knowledge-Augmented Generation (KAG) with traditional vector-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), EMVR provides superior performance in complex knowledge retrieval tasks.

The system leverages:
- **Graphiti/Neo4j** for structured knowledge representation and graph traversal
- **Qdrant** for efficient vector similarity search
- **mem0** for persistent memory and context management
- **LlamaIndex & LangChain** for flexible orchestration and agent-based workflows

## Features

- üîÑ **Hybrid Retrieval System** - Combines vector similarity search with graph-based knowledge retrieval
- üß† **Persistent Memory** - Maintains context and relationships across sessions
- üîç **Multi-modal Search** - Query across different data types and structures
- üîó **Knowledge Graph Integration** - Leverages structured relationships for improved context
- üöÄ **Framework Flexibility** - Works with both LlamaIndex and LangChain
- üìä **Extensible Architecture** - Easy to customize and extend for specific use cases
- üõ†Ô∏è **Developer-Friendly APIs** - Simple interfaces for complex retrieval operations
- üìà **Performance Optimization** - Efficient retrieval strategies for reduced latency

## Architecture

EMVR implements a layered architecture:

1. **Storage Layer**
   - Vector Database (Qdrant)
   - Graph Database (Neo4j via Graphiti)
   - Memory System (mem0)

2. **Integration Layer**
   - LlamaIndex Connectors
   - LangChain Components

3. **Orchestration Layer**
   - Hybrid Retrieval Manager
   - Context Fusion Engine
   - Knowledge Graph Traversal

4. **Application Layer**
   - Query Interfaces
   - Response Generation
   - Custom Agent Workflows

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker (recommended for Neo4j and Qdrant)
- Basic understanding of RAG systems

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BjornMelin/enhanced-mem-vector-rag.git
cd enhanced-mem-vector-rag

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### Quick Start

```python
from emvr import EmvrSystem

# Initialize the system
system = EmvrSystem()

# Load data
system.load_documents("path/to/documents")
system.build_knowledge_graph()

# Query the system
response = system.query("What is the relationship between X and Y?")
print(response)
```

## Components

### Memory System (mem0)

The memory component leverages mem0 to maintain persistent context across queries and sessions. This allows the system to:

- Remember previous interactions
- Build cumulative knowledge
- Maintain entity relationships
- Support temporal reasoning

### Graph Knowledge Base (Graphiti/Neo4j)

The graph component uses Graphiti with Neo4j to:

- Store structured relationships between entities
- Enable complex traversal queries
- Support reasoning about interconnected concepts
- Provide explicit knowledge paths

### Vector Storage (Qdrant)

The vector component uses Qdrant to:

- Store and retrieve document embeddings
- Perform efficient similarity search
- Support semantic matching
- Handle large-scale vector operations

### Framework Integration (LlamaIndex & LangChain)

EMVR integrates with both major RAG frameworks:

- **LlamaIndex** - For advanced indexing and retrieval operations
- **LangChain** - For agent-based workflows and tool integration

## Usage Examples

Examples are coming soon. They will demonstrate:

- Basic RAG workflows
- Knowledge graph integration
- Multi-hop reasoning
- Custom retrieval strategies
- Agent-based applications

## Configuration

EMVR can be configured through:

- Configuration files
- Environment variables
- Programmatic settings

Detailed configuration options will be provided in the upcoming documentation.

## Benchmarks

Performance benchmarks comparing EMVR to traditional RAG systems will be available soon.
